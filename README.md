# VanillaPlus-limited-public_repo

### THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCTION REPOSITORY FOR VanillaPlus!
This repository is a small sample of the work done for the VanillaPLus Terraria mod, available on Steam and tModLoader.  
The purpose of having this limited public repository is to:

a) display this work in my portfolio\
b) inspire people who play my mod with ideas for mods of their own\
c) educate budding modders as to how to implement specific functionalities they see in my mod

Most of the actual work for the mod can be found in the Items and Projectile directories.  
For new modders, be sure to check out the official ExampleMod public repository to get started with modding.
